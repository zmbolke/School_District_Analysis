#Purpose
The pourpose of this project is to upload and analyze testing data for a school district with 15 schools. The analysis takes into account certain criteria such as type of school, number of students, school budget, and budget per student. The data is then analysed using coding tools such as Pandas, Numpy, and Jupyter notebook.In the challenge, dishonest test reporting is suspected for the 9th graders at Thomas High School so this data is removed from the analysis below and compared to the original analysis.
